Simply download the latest release from the right or click "Code" and "Download ZIP" in the top right  
After that extract its contents into your garrysmod/ folder (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod`)  
Once youve done that it should be installed!

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute anything you think should be added! just make a pr and ill most likely merge it unless its stupid, if its a fix even better :)  
Just follow the code style and dont add *too much* useless garbage
