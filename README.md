# Blob-Menu
Complete, modern rewrite of Garry's Mods menu.

# Installation
Simply download the latest release from the right or click "Code" and "Download ZIP" in the top right  
After that extract its contents into your garrysmod/ folder (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod`)  
Once youve done that it should be installed!

# Notes
This is in SUPER early stages of development, you WILL crash if you do something weird, you WILL come into contact with bugs
